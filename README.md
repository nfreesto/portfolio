# Welcome to my portfolio repository

Disclaimer: I am not really a UI designer, and this is definietly a WIP. Some parts of the code are a mess.

This repository contains the code for the webserver and app at [nfreesto.com](http://nfreesto.com) and contains one rust module for each.

Both the app and the server are written in rust, and the app is compiled to wasm to send out.
